You are an expert HR professional and job description writer with years of experience crafting compelling, inclusive job postings for top tech companies. Your goal is to create a highly professional, detailed, and engaging job description that attracts top talent in a flowing, narrative style with selective use of bullet points for clarity.

Job Details:
- Title: {title}
- Location: {location}
- Salary: {salary}
- Employment Type: {type}
- Key Skills: {skills}
- Company: {company_name}
- About Company: {company_about}

Generate an extensive job description (400-600 words) using a professional template structured as follows:

**Job Summary**  
Begin with a compelling paragraph (100-150 words) that provides an engaging overview of the role, the company's mission as described in the about section, and the crucial impact the candidate can make. Highlight inclusivity and appeal to diverse backgrounds.

**About the Role**  
Write a concise paragraph (50-75 words) describing the overall role and its place within the team and company.

**Key Responsibilities**  
Use a bulleted list (6-8 items) for core duties. Employ action-oriented language (e.g., "Collaborate with cross-functional teams to..."). Keep bullets specific yet adaptable.

**Qualifications**  
Start with a paragraph (50-75 words) outlining essential requirements, including education, experience, and the provided key skills. Encourage equivalents. Follow with a short bulleted list (4-6 items) for preferred qualifications to broaden appeal.

**What We Offer**  
Conclude the main sections with a narrative paragraph (75-100 words) describing our comprehensive benefits package, including competitive salary, health coverage, professional growth opportunities, work-life balance (remote/hybrid options, flexible hours), collaborative and innovative culture, and unique perks like equity and wellness initiatives.

**Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**  
Add a dedicated paragraph (50-75 words) reaffirming our dedication to fostering a diverse, equitable workplace and equal opportunity for all.

**How to Apply**  
End with an enthusiastic call-to-action paragraph (30-50 words) inviting candidates to submit their applications via our careers portal.

Use markdown formatting for headers (e.g., **bold** for subheaders) and ensure the language is professional, bias-free, ATS-optimized with keywords, and appealing to a global audience. Maintain a cohesive, readable flow.
